# Blinded_files
A Python Script to blind files for analysis and record their original file names.


This script will blind the files in a directory for analysis. Ensure that this script is placed in the original directory with the original files to be blinded. It is non-destructive and will create a copy of the files to be blinded and record their identities to a text file. The script will ask for the file extension of the files to be blinded.
